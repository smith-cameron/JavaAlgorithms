Print 1-255
Write a program that would print all the numbers from 1 to 255

Odd Numbers
Write a program that would print all the odd numbers from 1 to 1000

Print Sum
Write a program that would print the sum of all the odd numbers from 1 to 5000

Iterating Through the Array
Given an array X say [1,3,5,7,9,13], write a program that would iterate through each member of the array and print each value

Find Max
Given an array with multiple values (e.g. [-3, 3, 5, 7]), write a program that prints the maximum number in the array. 

Find Average
Given an array with multiple values (e.g. [1,3,5,7,20]), write a program that prints the average of the values in the array.

Array With Odd Numbers
Write a program that creates an array 'Y' that contains all the odd numbers between 1 to 255. 

Greater Than Y
Write a program that takes an array and returns the number of values in that array whose value is greater than y.

Square the Values
Given an array x (e.g. [1,5, 10, -2]), create an algorithm that squares each value in the array.

Eliminate Negative Numbers
Given an array x (e.g. [1,5, 10, -2]), create an algorithm that replaces any negative number with the value of 0.

Max, Min, and Average
Given an array x (e.g. [1,5, 10, -2]), create an algorithm that prints the maximum number in the array, minimum value in the array as well as the average values in the array. 

Shifting the values in the array
Given an array x (e.g. [1,5, 10, 7, -2]), create an algorithm (sets of instructions) that shifts each number by one (to the front).  For example when the program is done x (assuming it was [1,5,10,7,-2]) should become [5,10,7,-2, 0].

Random Array
Create an array X and fill the array with 10 values, each value being a random integer between 0 to 100.

Swapping two values
Write a program that takes an array of numbers and returns an array where the first and last numbers in the array have been switched.

Reversing
Given an array X of multiple values (e.g. [-3,5,1,3,2,10]), write a program that reverses the values in the array.  Once your program is done X should be in the reserved order.  Do this without creating a temporary array.  Also, do NOT use the reverse method but find a way to reverse the values in the array

Insert X in Y
Write a program that inserts a new number X at an index Y. For example if array = [1, 3, 5, 7] and X = 10, and Y = 2, by the end of your program array should be [1, 3, 10, 5, 7] (in other words we added '10' on index 2). 

Removing Negatives
Given an array of multiple values (e.g. [0, -1, 2, -3, 4, -5, 6]), write a program that removes any negative values in that array.  Once your program is done, the array should be composed of only the non-negative numbers, in their original order.

Linear Search
Let's say we are given an array of unsorted numbers. We want to create a function called linearSearch that will take in two arguments: a number and an array. The function will return the position where the number is located in the array if found if it is not found it will return false.

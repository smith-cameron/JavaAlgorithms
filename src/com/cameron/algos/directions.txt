Print 1-255
Write a program that would print all the numbers from 1 to 255

Odd Numbers
Write a program that would print all the odd numbers from 1 to 1000

Print Sum
Write a program that would print the sum of all the odd numbers from 1 to 5000

Iterating Through the Array
Given an array X say [1,3,5,7,9,13], write a program that would iterate through each member of the array and print each value

Find Max
Given an array with multiple values (e.g. [-3, 3, 5, 7]), write a program that prints the maximum number in the array. 

Find Average
Given an array with multiple values (e.g. [1,3,5,7,20]), write a program that prints the average of the values in the array.

Array With Odd Numbers
Write a program that creates an array 'Y' that contains all the odd numbers between 1 to 255. 

Greater Than Y
Write a program that takes an array and returns the number of values in that array whose value is greater than y.

Square the Values
Given an array x (e.g. [1,5, 10, -2]), create an algorithm (sets of instructions) that squares each value in the array.

Eliminate Negative Numbers
Given an array x (e.g. [1,5, 10, -2]), create an algorithm (sets of instructions) that replaces any negative number with the value of 0.

Max, Min, and Average
Given an array x (e.g. [1,5, 10, -2]), create an algorithm (sets of instructions) that prints the maximum number in the array, minimum value in the array as well as the average values in the array.
